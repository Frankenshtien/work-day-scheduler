# Work Day Scheduler Challenge

In this challenge I was tasked with creating a day planner using a bit of starter code provided, Javascript/Jquery, HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, and MomentJS.

**M Process**

- I first edited the HTML document and added to appropriate Bootstrap/CSS classes to create the schedule grid.

- I used MomentJS to create a day and time that actively updates itself to the current time, and added it to the top of the page.

- I used Jquery ($) to add event listeners for a click on the event description area. A click will turn it into a textarea that you can then add your event to. Clicking the save button then should have the event to local storage.
